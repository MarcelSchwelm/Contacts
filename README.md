# Contacts
The following lines describe the project in short (JetBrains Academy). The text is taken from: https://hyperskill.org/projects/43

About

Here is something you probably use regularly: contacts. In this project, you will write a program to create contacts (like on the mobile phone) and search for people or organizations by name.

Learning outcomes

You will learn the essential basics of object-oriented programming: encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Inheritance will allow you to write code that can perform the same process but for different objects. Polymorphism helps to initiate different processes for different objects by using the same method. You’ll also learn to prevent other users of your code to modify the variables using encapsulation.
This project is a part of the following track

Java Developer

What you’ll do and what you’ll learn:
Using classes, create your first contact with a name, last name and phone number.
Working with encapsulation and regular expressions, create a menu that will allow to add and edit contacts.
With the help of inheritance mechanism, add the ability to specify details in your contacts (for example, gender) and to create contacts and addresses of organizations.
Get familiar with polymorphism and built-in functions: fix your code and make it possible to search for contacts.
